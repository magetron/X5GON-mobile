<p>Patrick Wu, Yinrui Hu</p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><img src="instant-markdown-d_files/team.png" alt="teammate"></p>
<p>Hello, we are Team 4. My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-daiqi-wu/">Patrick Wu</a>,
 the team lead and a 2nd-Year Computer Science student at University 
College London. My interest mainly lies in low-level system design and 
networked systems. For this summer, I'm going to intern at a trading 
firm working on its infrastructural components.
My teammate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yinrui-hu-050215182/">Yinrui(Felix) Hu</a>,
 is also a second-year computer science student studying at UCL. He is 
mostly interested in artificial intelligence and cyber-security related 
fields.
I am delighted to be working with Yinrui this year, and developed a 
brand new mobile application with many innovative approaches for UCL's 
X5Learn research team, our industrial partner.</p>
<h2>What have we been working on?</h2>
<p>Online Education is no stranger to us, students, nowadays, as we have
 been utilising this extensively in day to day life. For instance, due 
to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, UCL students would all logon to Moodle 
to conduct remote learning through contents of formats including but not
 limited to videos, texts and audios. Apart from Moodle, there are such a
 great number of alternatives out there, e.g. Coursera, Khan Academy, 
LinkedIn Learning, MIT Open Courseware and many more. The trouble mainly
 lies which platform to choose instead of a lack of learning materials. 
As a student, we have spent way too long looking for a useful resource 
rather than learning itself. Therefore, X5GON and X5Learn as a 
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), can solve this problem for you.</p>
<p>The main focus of X5GON development team is creating a solution that 
will help users/students find what they need not just in OER 
repositories, but across all open educational resources on the web. This
 solution will adapt to the user's needs and learn how to make ongoing 
customised recommendations and suggestions through a truly interactive 
and impactful learning experience.</p>
<p><img src="instant-markdown-d_files/desktop.png" alt="website version of X5Learn"></p>

<p>Our goal, as a student team, is to develop a mobile application that 
utilises the X5Learn platform and provide an authentic and 
mobile-friendly user experience. With this mobile application, the 
X5Learn system would be able to attract more customers from the mobile 
platform and enable users to access their customised X5Learn learning 
contents at all times.</p>
<h2>What are the technical challenges?</h2>
<p>The critical challenge above all is to differentiate our application 
from other proprietary learning platforms. We continuously ask ourselves
 how to make the app more accessible and easy to navigate around for 
users. Given the fact there are many established applications out there,
 our team considered trying them out ourselves and conduct double-blind 
experiments on UI, app responsiveness and content relevancy experiments.
 We have learnt a lot in the process and greatly influenced our design 
of X5GON-Mobile afterwards.</p>
<p>Whilst we are testing out multiple applications under the <code>eduroam</code>
 network environment, there was one significant issue that emerged out 
of the dark. Some apps, under mediocre network environment, suffered 
from constant loss of network connection and plodding loading speed. 
Also, given the fact that the X5Learn usually takes 10 to 15 seconds to 
process videos and generate analytic reports, these together makes the 
app increasingly laggy and unusable at all under such circumstances. 
This issue of performance we noticed at an early stage influenced our 
application design and development process thereafter and is proven to 
be a significant differentiating factor for our application.</p>
<p>Last but not least, another essential technical challenge we faced 
was that the X5Learn was in ongoing development. Hence, many of the 
functionalities we aim to accomplish in our project are still in 
development or doesn't exist as an API from the back-end. This caused us
 considerable trouble initially. However, we were able to overcome this 
difficulty eventually and made our application more adaptable to this 
type of situation, which would be beneficial for future expansion of the
 whole platform after our delivery of the project.</p>
<h2>How did we solve them?</h2>
<p><img src="instant-markdown-d_files/technologies.png" alt="technologies at glance"></p>
<p>Figure 2. An overview of the technologies used in this project.</p>
<p>We tackled challenges above using advanced technology provided by <code>Apple</code>, the open-source community and algorithms written by ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="instant-markdown-d_files/comparison.png" alt="comparison of app"></p>
<p>Figure 3. A comparison between traditional learning app and our approach.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, we took the information-feed approach 
rather than listing all courses available for the users find. As on most
 other platforms, users would have to search for what they want to 
learn, we actively push this information to the screen for users to 
choose from, similar to video sites but unlike a learning platform. Our 
design also utilises an innovative way of enabling users to read 
bullet-points or browse external supportive contents. Users can scroll 
to a sidebar whilst not stopping the video and start from there. They 
can also minimise the video to let it play as a floating window at the 
bottom of the screen. This design received great feedback from our 
clients and users at our testing stage.</p>
<p><img src="instant-markdown-d_files/performance.gif" alt="fast fetching optimisation"></p>
<p>Figure 4. A demonstration of our app's performance on videos.</p>
<p>With regards to the performance of the application, we utilised 
extensive caching and predicting techniques to minimise the lag and 
increase the responsiveness. First of all, the choice of using <code>Swift</code> to develop a native <code>iOS</code> application provides us with a faster foundation compared to hybrid frameworks like <code>React Native</code>. More so, our aggressive pre-loading daemon utilised a <code>HashMap</code>
 storing technique and regularly fetches first 20-seconds of content 
whenever user finds the thumbnail on display. Although we did make a 
trade-off of having more background tasks, which is negligible, app 
users now receive a notably faster application and smoother learning 
experience.</p>
<p>As a project that has both the ongoing development of front-end and 
back-end at the same time, we found it challenging to adapt to the 
constant changing API as an external mobile application. Therefore, we 
then utilised <code>SwiftSoup</code>, an external parser for HTML,
together with our own algorithm to analyse changing API endpoints on the
 fly and self-adapt the code. This still at an early stage and would 
require a constant change of code to actually make the new version work.
 However, this adaptive API layer has undoubtedly saved us a lot of time
 investigating broken APIs and migrating to new ones.</p>
<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Having never developed an <code>iOS</code> application, we have learned a lot about <code>Apple</code> 's tool-chain and especially the <code>Swift</code> language. While developing this project, an issue among which also encouraged to make an actual contribution to the <code>apple/swift</code>
 language on its co-routine implementation. Our team find this year of 
cooperating with UCL's X5Learn Team very enjoyable and worthwhile.</p>
