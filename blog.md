# An innovative approach to re-design mobile learning experience with X5Learn

## About Us

Hello, we are Team 4. My name is Patrick,  the team lead and a 2nd-Year Computer Science student at University College London. My interest mainly lies in low-level system design and networked systems. For this summer, I’m going to intern at a trading firm working on its infrastructural components.
My teammate Yinrui(Felix) Hu, is also a second-year computer science student studying at UCL. He is mostly interested in artificial intelligence and cyber-security related fields.
I am delighted to be working with Yinrui this year, and developed a brand new mobile application with many innovative approaches for UCL’s X5Learn research team, our industrial partner.
